# DevelopersHub_coorporation_DS_Inrerns_Task_2025
This repository consist on 5 tasks solutions which were assigned by developerHub coorporation to the Data science interns 2025

****Task1****
****Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset****
****Objective:****
 Understand how to read, summarize, and visualize a dataset.
****Dataset:****
 Iris Dataset (CSV format, available through seaborn or other open sources)
****Instructions:****
● Load the dataset using the pandas library.
● Display dataset structure using .shape, .columns, and .head(). 
● Create basic visualizations:
  ○ Scatter plot to analyze relationships between variables.
  ○ Histogram to examine data distribution.
  ○ Box plot to detect outliers and spread of values.
● Use matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations. 

****Task2****
****Credit Risk Prediction****
****Objective:****
 Predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default on a loan.
****Dataset:****
 Loan Prediction Dataset (available on Kaggle)
*****Instructions:****
● Handle missing data appropriately.
● Visualize key features such as loan amount, education, and income.
● Train a classification model like Logistic Regression or Decision Tree.
● Evaluate the model using accuracy and a confusion matrix. 


****TASK#****
****Customer Churn Prediction (Bank Customers)****
****Objective:****
 Identify customers who are likely to leave the bank.
****Dataset:****
 Churn Modelling Dataset
****Instructions:****
● Clean and prepare the dataset.
● Encode categorical features such as geography and gender.
● Train a classification model.
● Analyze feature importance to understand what influences churn.

****Task4****

****Predicting Insurance Claim Amounts****
****Objective:****
 Estimate the medical insurance claim amount based on personal data.
****Dataset:****
 Medical Cost Personal Dataset
****Instructions:****
● Train a Linear Regression model to predict charges.
● Visualize how BMI, age, and smoking status impact insurance charges.
● Evaluate model performance using MAE and RMSE

****Task5****
****Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction****
****Objective:****
 Predict which customers are likely to accept a personal loan offer.
****Dataset:****
 Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)
****Instructions:****
● Perform basic data exploration on features such as age, job, and marital status.
● Train a Logistic Regression or Decision Tree classifier.
● Analyze the results to identify which customer groups are more likely to accept the offer.


I donwloded each dataset from keggle website and followed the given instructions in each task .In the attached tasks nootbooks i have mensioned the explaination of  codes using cumments and text fields and write conclusion that what we get from this analysis.
i used different libraries :
Pandas
Numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
sk_learn

my approch was :
Dataset Loading
Data Preprcessing(Handling missing values , Categorical feeatures and data types)
Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
Model Training
Model Evaluation

****I have completed 5/5 Tasks****
Thakns to DevelopersHub coorporation and team for giving us the opertunity.
Looking forward for future work
